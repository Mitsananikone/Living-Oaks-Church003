            Simply put, the Northern Brazoria County Area is one of the fastest
            growing areas connected to Houston. The Alvin ISD is the 7th fastest
            growing school district in Texas, with a projection to grow by 7000
            students in the next 10 years.
            <br />
            Alvin is next on TxDOT's plan to expand highway 99, projecting 4000
            new home builds during that time. The fact is, Alvin is going to
            need more Gospel-centered churches.
